## Introduction
The Fitness Tracker Data Engineering project leverages Apache Spark, Scala, Docker, and IntelliJ to process and analyze fitness tracker data. This project aims to derive actionable insights to help businesses in the fitness industry understand user behavior, optimize product offerings, and improve customer engagement. It demonstrates how modern data engineering techniques can transform raw data into valuable business intelligence.

## Objectives
1. **Data Ingestion:** Efficiently read and load raw fitness tracker data from a CSV file into a Spark DataFrame.
2. **Data Transformation:** Clean, format, and transform the data for consistent and usable analysis.
3. **Data Analysis:** Extract insights on user activity patterns, calorie consumption, and popular activities to inform business decisions.

## Business Problem
A fitness tracker company collects vast amounts of user activity and health metrics data. However, this raw data is underutilized due to its complexity and volume. This project aims to address this issue by:
- **Understand User Behavior:** Identifying patterns in user activities to tailor fitness programs and product recommendations.
- **Optimize Product Offerings:** Determining the most popular activities among different demographics to enhance product features and marketing strategies.
- **Improve Customer Engagement:** Using insights on user activity and calorie consumption to develop personalized fitness plans and recommendations.

## Tech Stack
- **Apache Spark:** Distributed data processing and analysis.
- **Scala:** Efficient data manipulation and functional programming.
- **Docker:** Create a reproducible and consistent development environment.
- **IntelliJ IDEA:** IDE for development, debugging, and testing.

## Key Components

### Data Ingestion
- Load raw fitness tracker data from a CSV file using Sparkâ€™s DataFrame API, ensuring efficient handling of large datasets.

### Data Transformation
- **Activity Column Formatting:** Standardize activity names by removing underscores and renaming columns for consistency.
- **Timestamp Formatting:** Convert timestamp strings into proper timestamp data types for accurate time-based analysis.

### Data Analysis
- **Calorie Burn Analysis:** Aggregate and rank users based on total calories burned to identify the most active users.
- **Activity Analysis Among Females:** Determine the most popular activities among female users using both DataFrame API and SQL queries, providing insights into gender-specific preferences.

## Detailed Analysis Approach

### Calorie Burn Analysis
- Aggregate total calories burned by each user to identify top performers.
- Use this data to tailor advanced fitness programs for high-performing users, enhancing user satisfaction and retention.

### Activity Analysis Among Females
- Filter data to focus on female users.
- Group activities by popularity to understand preferences and tailor marketing strategies.
- Use SQL-style queries to validate results and ensure consistency.

## Conclusion
The Fitness Tracker Data Engineering project demonstrates how advanced data engineering techniques can transform raw fitness tracker data into actionable business insights. By utilizing Apache Spark and Scala, the project efficiently handles large datasets, performs complex transformations, and conducts detailed analyses. Docker ensures a consistent development environment, while IntelliJ IDEA provides a robust platform for code development. The insights gained from this project can help fitness companies understand user behavior, optimize product offerings, and improve customer engagement, ultimately driving business growth.
